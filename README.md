# Pokedex Project

## Desctiption
This is a basic Pokedex project witch fetches data from the public API https://pokeapi.co/ and displays the OG 151 Pokemon, with a few features implemented such as filtering, searching, 
and liking/ unliking Pokemon, which adds them to a favourites container.
<br><br>
I used this video to help me with the intial setup of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVtnFH4m_fE
<br>
In addition to this video, I then added extra features which I had learned at Academy XI, to enable me to filter, search, and toggle like.
<br><br>
In the future, I would love to develop this project further. There are a few things I am struggling to make work, for example
combining the filter and search functions so that if the Pokemon are filtered by type, when I try to search for a pokemon via name or number, it only searches through the available filtered pokemon.
